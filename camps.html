	<h1>Xinjiang Re-education Camps</h1>
	<div id="bodytext">
		The unrest in the Xinjiang region has sparked many cases of violence, and has been met with “counter-terrorism” efforts from the Chinese government. This series of conflicts has deepened the divide between the Uyghur and the Han and further perpetuates the mutual prejudice between the two ethnic groups.
		<blockquote>
		“...during the Gulja Incident during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in February 1997, a series of riots and demonstrations occurred due to crackdowns by Chinese authorities on traditional Uyghur culture, including most notably the banning of traditional social gatherings (meshrep). More recently in July 2009, violent riots in the region’s capital, Urumqi, resulted in 197 Uyghur and Han deaths and 1,721 injured.” [1]
		</blockquote>
		The extent of China’s “counter-terrorism” measures is unclear. It is known at the very least that in recent years there have been locations throughout Xinjiang in which many of the Uyghur population are put through re-education programs as part of China’s official efforts to suppress extremist ideology. These locations have been visited by diplomats from non-western countries such as Russia, Indonesia, India, Thailand, and Kazakhstan and a “small group of foreign reporters, including Reuters.” [6] Gay McDougall of the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination estimates based on “credible” evidence that there have been over a million Uyghurs interned in camps throughout the area. [7] Without opportunity for more thorough and transparent research, however, it is hard to confirm any concrete data about the numbers or the internal activities of these camps.
