		The region that would be known as Xinjiang was a major center of the Silk Road
		Throughout their history, the Uyghur people have been influenced by nearby powers, including the Mongols, Russia, Britain, and Turkey starting from the late 19th century until the fall of the Ottoman Empire [1]
		Qing Empire annexed East Turkestan and named the area Xinjiang in 1884 [1]
		In 1911, Xinjiang became part of the Republic of China under the Kuomintang. There were two uprisings since then, forming two East Turkestan republics until 1949 when it became the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) under the Communism Party of China. [1]<br><br>
