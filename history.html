		The region that would be known as Xinjiang, in particular the city of Kashgar, was a major stop along the northern route of the Silk Road.
		<br><br>
		Throughout their history, the Uyghur people have been influenced by nearby powers, including the Mongols, Russia, Britain, and Turkey starting from the late 19th century until the fall of the Ottoman Empire shortly after the end of World War I. [1]
		<br><br>
		The Manchu-founded Qing Empire annexed East Turkestan in 1884 and gave the area its current name, Xinjiang. [1]
		<br><br>
		In 1911, Xinjiang became part of the Republic of China under the Kuomintang. There have been two uprisings since then, briefly forming the First and Second East Turkestan Republics until 1949 when it became incorporated into the People’s Republic of China as the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR). [1]
		<br><br>
		Nowadays Uyghurs in Xinjiang are a primarily Sunni Muslim group of roughly 10 million, representing nearly half of the Xinjiang population. [2]
